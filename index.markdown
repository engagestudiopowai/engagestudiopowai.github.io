    <h1>Engage Studio Powai â€“ A Firsthand Review of a Misleading and Unprofessional Experience</h1>

    <hr />

    <h2>Summary of the Experience</h2>
    <p>I had booked Engage Studio Powai in good faith for my childâ€™s birthday party, scheduled for July. A deposit of â‚¹5,000 was paid on May 27th, while final activities and event details were still being discussed. A few days later, due to unavoidable travel plans, I informed the studio that I would not be going ahead with the booking. This was well over a month before the event date.</p>
    <p>However, what followed was shocking and disappointing.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Misleading Terms and Lack of Transparency</h2>
    <p>The studioâ€™s owner refused to refund the â‚¹5,000 deposit, citing a vague "non-refundable policy" â€” which, until that moment, had only been mentioned in a WhatsApp message. There was no signed agreement, no formal T&Cs shared beforehand, and definitely no transparency around what the deposit would be used for.</p>
    <p>If no activities had been finalized, how were vendors already paid as claimed?</p>
    <p>If you did pay them â€” please show proof or receipts.</p>
    <p>And if your claim is that there was no opportunity to explain this â€” I have multiple follow-ups documented over four days, with no resolution and no intent to communicate honestly.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Owner Conduct and Setup Issues</h2>
    <p>The studio is run by someone I can only describe as a money-first business owner, lacking basic courtesy and professionalism. Instead of having a respectful dialogue, the owner was defensive, evasive, and dismissive.</p>
    <p>Letâ€™s be clear:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>â‚¹5,000 was kept without any service being rendered.</li>
        <li>No efforts were made to resolve the issue.</li>
        <li>Excuses were made to justify keeping someone elseâ€™s money.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This goes beyond business â€” it speaks to values.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Feedback on Venue and Activities</h2>
    <p>Looking back, Iâ€™m glad I didnâ€™t proceed with the booking. The space is small, overpriced, and poorly maintained, with unjustifiably high costs for very average DIY activities. I have since heard from other parents that the activities are boring, the team lacks energy, and the overall setup is underwhelming for what it charges.</p>
    <p>This isnâ€™t a nurturing space. Itâ€™s a transactional one.</p>

    <h2>Final Word â€“ Parents, Be Cautious</h2>
    <p>If you're considering Engage Studio Powai for your childâ€™s event or activity, please be aware:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No formal contracts</li>
        <li>Non-refundable deposits without clarity</li>
        <li>Unprofessional behavior when questioned</li>
        <li>Small space, poor value</li>
        <li>Cold, unempathetic customer service</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have screenshots of all correspondence to back up every point above. What you see on Instagram is not what you get.</p>
