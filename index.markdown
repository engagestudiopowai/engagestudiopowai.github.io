    <h2>Clarification on a Google Review for <strong>Engage The Creative Studio</strong></h2>

    <p class="intro-text">This page addresses and provides clarification regarding specific claims made in a recent review concerning <strong>Engage The Creative Studio</strong>.</p>

    <p>In response to the reviewer's allegations about event planning and vendor payments at Engage The Creative Studio:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Activities for the event were not yet finalized. We question how vendor payments could have been made at such an early stage.</li>
        <li>Paying vendors for an event a month in advance is highly unconventional. We request receipts to demonstrate how the stated â‚¹5,000 deposit was utilized.</li>
        <li>The claim of not being given a chance to communicate is inaccurate. We initiated follow-ups over four consecutive days, providing ample opportunity for dialogue.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We possess message screenshots that substantiate our position on these points. The assertions made by the reviewer appear to misrepresent the business practices of <strong>Engage The Creative Studio</strong> and the circumstances surrounding the booking.</p>
