<h2>Important Clarification & Review</h2>

<p class="intro-text">Adding another clarification since this person is still lying.</p>

<ol>
    <li>We had not even closed the activities to be done. How did you pay the vendors then?</li>
    <li>Who pays vendors for an event a month in advance? In that case plz show me reciepts of the payment so I know how the 5k was used.</li>
    <li>You're saying I didn't give a chance to communicate this - I have followed up over four days. When were you not given a chance?</li>
</ol>

<p>I have message screenshots for all the above. The fact that you want to fleece people and lie to everyone just shows what kind of business you're running.</p>


Owner is a money grabbing scam artist.

<p>Had booked for a birthday party in July - gave the deposit on 27th May and decided to not go ahead a couple of days later due to travel plans coming up. This is more than a month before the date confirmed but the owner has decided to still keep the deposit paid citing 'terms and conditions'. This is just a whatsapp message saying non refundable deposit. The whole setup is extremely unprofessional with unreasonable costs, small space and smaller minded owner. Happy to not have gone ahead with this, have heard reviews from others also about how the DIY activities are boring.</p>
