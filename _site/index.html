    <h2>Clarification on a Google Review for <strong>Engage The Creative Studio</strong></h2>

    <p class="intro-text">This page addresses and provides clarification regarding specific claims made in a recent review concerning <strong>Engage The Creative Studio</strong>.</p>

    <p>In response to the reviewer's allegations about event planning and vendor payments at Engage The Creative Studio:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Activities for the event were not yet finalized. We question how vendor payments could have been made at such an early stage.</li>
        <li>Paying vendors for an event a month in advance is highly unconventional. We request receipts to demonstrate how the stated â‚¹5,000 deposit was utilized.</li>
        <li>The claim of not being given a chance to communicate is inaccurate. We initiated follow-ups over four consecutive days, providing ample opportunity for dialogue.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We possess message screenshots that substantiate our position on these points. The assertions made by the reviewer appear to misrepresent the business practices of <strong>Engage The Creative Studio</strong> and the circumstances surrounding the booking.</p>

    <h3>Understanding the Customer Review About <strong>Engage The Creative Studio</strong></h3>

    <p>The review details a booking made for a birthday party in July, with a deposit paid to <strong>Engage The Creative Studio</strong> on May 27th. The reviewer states they decided to cancel a couple of days later due to unforeseen travel plans, which was over a month before the confirmed event date. Despite this early cancellation, <strong>Engage The Creative Studio</strong> reportedly retained the deposit, citing a "non-refundable deposit" policy communicated via a WhatsApp message.</p>

    <p>The reviewer further criticizes <strong>Engage The Creative Studio</strong> for what they describe as an unprofessional setup, unreasonable costs, a small venue space, and a "smaller minded owner." They express satisfaction with having cancelled and mention hearing other negative reviews about the "DIY activities being boring."</p>
